## Premise

In *THyper-Drive*, you drive a fast futuristic car through endless traffic on a dangerous highway. But this time, you're not just dodging cars — you can shoot! Blast your way forward by destroying obstacles in your path. The road never ends, and the game gets harder the longer you survive. 

**Your goal:** reach the highest score by driving far, dodging, and shooting everything that gets in your way.

## Gameplay

This game is made for PC and only needs a keyboard to play. The car moves forward by itself. Your job is to:

- Steer left and right
- Avoid enemy cars

The more distance you cover, the higher your score. If you crash into something, the game ends. Try again and beat your high score!
